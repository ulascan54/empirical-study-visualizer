# Empirical Study Visualizer

Empirical Study Visualizer is a React application for visualizing various sorting algorithms. This project is inspired by the [Sorting Visualizer GitHub Page](https://clementmihailescu.github.io/Sorting-Visualizer/) and is based on the repository found [here](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer).

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (>= 6.x)

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/empirical-study-visualizer.git
cd empirical-study-visualizer
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

To start the application in development mode, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

### Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

### Ejecting

If you need to customize the configuration, you can "eject" from Create React App by running:

```bash
npm run eject
```

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back!**
